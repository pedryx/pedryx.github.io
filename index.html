                    <p>This project is a part of my bachelor's thesis, and it is currently a work in progress. The primary objective of this project is to explore options of the entity-component-system (ECS) pattern and to implement a game using various ECS libraries and conduct performance evaluation.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Central to this project is the abstract ECS layer, which serves as an interface for ECS libraries. The game is designed to operate with this abstract layer, ensuring its independence from any specific ECS library.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>One of the core concepts of the game revolves around the simulation of a procedurally generated world. Through the utilization of GPU shaders, the entire world is procedurally generated at runtime. Within this virtual world, you'll find villages inhabited by villagers, each of whom possesses a simple AI system which utilizes behavior trees.</p>

                    <p>Top-down zombie shooter game, where your aim is to achieve the highest score possible. This game was created for the Ludum Dare game jam in 72 hours. It utilizes the HypEcs library for entity-component-system. Moreover, it incorporates a range of features that enhance the user experience.</p>

                    <p><strong>Unfinished reimplementation of a game called "Run to the Stairs."</strong> The entire project is divided into three parts:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>GameLib:</strong> This is a library designed for creating games using Monogame as a foundation. It's built to be independent of both the rendering library and the operating system.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>RunToTheStairs:</strong> This library actually implements the game itself by utilizing the GameLib library. Similar to GameLib, it remains detached from the rendering library and operating system.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>RunToTheStairs.WPF:</strong> It serves as a concrete implementation of the game for Windows. It makes use of WPF and SkiaSharp for rendering.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>One of the features of this project is its abstract design, which enables the potential for expansion onto different operating systems and rendering libraries. Additionally, the project operates under the notion that a texture is defined just as something with width and height. This flexibility even opens up the possibility of implementing it within a console environment.</p>
